## Current

### [Gmanim](https://gmanim.github.io/) (closed source)
- A desktop interface that wraps Manim (a mathematical animation tool), in hopes of making it more accesible
- The Swift version is no longer supported, I am currently rewriting Gmanim in C (along with some native code)
- Note: the website was made before I knew proper html/css/js, and is therefore limited in functionality and appearance 

### A secret...
- Details available at a later time

- An Android mobile game where you control two thrusters of a rocket ship in an effort to slowly descend to the surface of Titan

### [MJ Tool](https://github.com/enigmurl/mjtool)
